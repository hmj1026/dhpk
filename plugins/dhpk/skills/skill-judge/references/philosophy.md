# Skill Judge — Evaluation Philosophy

Self-contained mental model for `skill-judge`. Load this when you need the "why" behind the rubric — what a Skill fundamentally is, the knowledge-delta lens for the First Pass scan, and the meta-question to return to when a score feels off.

## What is a Skill?

A Skill is NOT a tutorial. A Skill is a **knowledge externalization mechanism**.

Traditional AI knowledge is locked in model parameters. To teach new capabilities:
```
Traditional: Collect data → GPU cluster → Train → Deploy new version
Cost: $10,000 - $1,000,000+
Timeline: Weeks to months
```

Skills change this:
```
Skill: Edit SKILL.md → Save → Takes effect on next invocation
Cost: $0
Timeline: Instant
```

This is the paradigm shift from "training AI" to "educating AI" — like a hot-swappable LoRA adapter that requires no training. You edit a Markdown file in natural language, and the model's behavior changes.

## The Core Formula

> **Good Skill = Expert-only Knowledge − What Claude Already Knows**

A Skill's value is measured by its **knowledge delta** — the gap between what it provides and what the model already knows.

- **Expert-only knowledge**: Decision trees, trade-offs, edge cases, anti-patterns, domain-specific thinking frameworks — things that take years of experience to accumulate
- **What Claude already knows**: Basic concepts, standard library usage, common programming patterns, general best practices

When a Skill explains "what is PDF" or "how to write a for-loop", it's compressing knowledge Claude already has. This is **token waste** — context window is a public resource shared with system prompts, conversation history, other Skills, and user requests.

## Tool vs Skill

| Concept | Essence | Function | Example |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Tool** | What model CAN do | Execute actions | bash, read_file, write_file, WebSearch |
| **Skill** | What model KNOWS how to do | Guide decisions | PDF processing, MCP building, frontend design |

Tools define capability boundaries — without bash tool, model can't execute commands.
Skills inject knowledge — without frontend-design Skill, model produces generic UI.

**The equation**:
```
General Agent + Excellent Skill = Domain Expert Agent
```

Same Claude model, different Skills loaded, becomes different experts.

## Three Types of Knowledge in Skills

When evaluating, categorize each section:

| Type | Definition | Treatment |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **Expert** | Claude genuinely doesn't know this | Must keep — this is the Skill's value |
| **Activation** | Claude knows but may not think of | Keep if brief — serves as reminder |
| **Redundant** | Claude definitely knows this | Should delete — wastes tokens |

The art of Skill design is maximizing Expert content, using Activation sparingly, and eliminating Redundant ruthlessly.

## The Meta-Question

When evaluating any Skill, always return to this fundamental question:

> **"Would an expert in this domain, looking at this Skill, say:**
> **'Yes, this captures knowledge that took me years to learn'?"**

If the answer is yes → the Skill has genuine value.
If the answer is no → it's compressing what Claude already knows.

The best Skills are **compressed expert brains** — they take a designer's 10 years of aesthetic accumulation and compress it into 43 lines, or a document expert's operational experience into a 200-line decision tree.

What gets compressed must be things Claude doesn't have. Otherwise, it's garbage compression.

## Self-Evaluation Note

This Skill (skill-judge) should itself pass evaluation:

- **Knowledge Delta**: Provides specific evaluation criteria Claude wouldn't generate on its own
- **Mindset**: Shapes how to think about Skill quality, not just checklist items
- **Anti-Patterns**: "NEVER Do When Evaluating" section with specific don'ts
- **Specification**: Valid frontmatter with comprehensive description
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Lean SKILL.md routing to references on demand
- **Freedom**: Medium freedom appropriate for evaluation task
- **Pattern**: Follows Tool pattern with decision frameworks
- **Usability**: Clear protocol, report template, quick reference

Evaluate this Skill against itself as a calibration exercise.
