# Confidence Scoring

Reference for how an instinct's confidence is interpreted and how it changes over
time. Read when tuning thresholds, deciding whether an instinct should auto-apply,
or interpreting `/instinct-status` output.

Confidence evolves over time:

| Score | Meaning | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 0.3 | Tentative | Suggested but not enforced |
| 0.5 | Moderate | Applied when relevant |
| 0.7 | Strong | Auto-approved for application |
| 0.9 | Near-certain | Core behavior |

**Confidence increases** when:

- Pattern is repeatedly observed
- User doesn't correct the suggested behavior
- Similar instincts from other sources agree

**Confidence decreases** when:

- User explicitly corrects the behavior
- Pattern isn't observed for extended periods
- Contradicting evidence appears
