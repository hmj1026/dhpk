# Promote Command

## Contract

Use explicitly to promote qualifying project instincts; not to modify skills or
rules. See the [command contract](../docs/agent-guidance/command-contract.md).
Stop on a missing instinct or failed write; completion reports promoted,
skipped, and dry-run counts.

Promote instincts from project scope to global scope in continuous-learning-v2.

## Implementation

Run the instinct CLI using the plugin root path:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dhpk-continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py" promote [instinct-id] [--force] [--dry-run]
```

Or if `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is not set (manual installation):

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/dhpk-continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py promote [instinct-id] [--force] [--dry-run]
```

## Usage

```bash
/promote                      # Auto-detect promotion candidates
/promote --dry-run            # Preview auto-promotion candidates
/promote --force              # Promote all qualified candidates without prompt
/promote grep-before-edit     # Promote one specific instinct from current project
```

## What to Do

1. Detect current project
2. If `instinct-id` is provided, promote only that instinct (if present in current project)
3. Otherwise, find cross-project candidates that:
   - Appear in at least 2 projects
   - Meet confidence threshold
4. Write promoted instincts to `~/.claude/homunculus/instincts/personal/` with `scope: global`
