# Version History, Compatibility & Privacy

Reference for what changed across versions, backward-compatibility guarantees, and
the privacy model. Read when migrating from v1/v2.0, explaining version differences,
or auditing what data leaves the machine.

## What's New in v2.1

| Feature | v2.0 | v2.1 |
|---------|------|------|
| Storage | Global (`~/.claude/homunculus/`) | Project-scoped (`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/ecc-homunculus/projects/<hash>/`) |
| Scope | All instincts apply everywhere | Project-scoped + global |
| Detection | None | git remote URL / repo path |
| Promotion | N/A | Project → global when seen in 2+ projects |
| Commands | 4 (status/evolve/export/import) | 6 (+promote/projects) |
| Cross-project | Contamination risk | Isolated by default |

## What's New in v2 (vs v1)

| Feature | v1 | v2 |
|---------|----|----|
| Observation | Stop hook (session end) | PreToolUse/PostToolUse (100% reliable) |
| Analysis | Main context | Background agent (Haiku) |
| Granularity | Full skills | Atomic "instincts" |
| Confidence | None | 0.3-0.9 weighted |
| Evolution | Direct to skill | Instincts -> cluster -> skill/command/agent |
| Sharing | None | Export/import instincts |

## Backward Compatibility

v2.1 is fully compatible with v2.0 and v1:

- Existing global instincts can be migrated from `~/.claude/homunculus/instincts/`
  with `scripts/migrate-homunculus.sh`
- Existing `~/.claude/skills/learned/` skills from v1 still work
- Stop hook still runs (but now also feeds into v2)
- Gradual migration: run both in parallel

## Privacy

- Observations stay **local** on your machine
- Project-scoped instincts are isolated per project
- Only **instincts** (patterns) can be exported — not raw observations
- No actual code or conversation content is shared
- You control what gets exported and promoted
