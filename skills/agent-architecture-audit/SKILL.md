description: 'Full-stack diagnostic for agent and LLM applications — audits the 12-layer agent stack for wrapper regression, memory pollution, tool-discipline failures, hidden repair loops, and rendering corruption. Use when: shipping an agent/LLM feature, an agent degrades after adding wrapper/memory/tool layers, the same model works in the playground but breaks in your wrapper, or debugging agent behavior >15 min with no root cause. Not for: general code debugging, code review, or security scanning (use security-review). Output: severity-ranked findings with code-first fixes.'

# Agent Architecture Audit

A diagnostic workflow for agent systems that hide failures behind wrapper layers, stale memory, retry loops, or transport/rendering mutations.

## When to Activate

**MANDATORY for:**
- Releasing any agent or LLM-powered application to production
- Shipping features with tool calling, memory, or multi-step workflows
- Agent behavior degrades after adding wrapper layers
- User reports "the agent is getting worse" or "tools are flaky"
- Same model works in playground but breaks inside your wrapper
- Debugging agent behavior for more than 15 minutes without finding root cause

**Especially critical when:**
- You've added new prompt layers, tool definitions, or memory systems
- Different agents in your system behave inconsistently
- The model was fine yesterday but is hallucinating today
- You suspect hidden repair/retry loops silently mutating responses

## When NOT to Use

- General code debugging — use `agent-introspection-debugging`
- Code review — use language-specific reviewer agents
- Security scanning — use `security-review` or `security-review/scan`
- Agent performance benchmarking — use `agent-eval`
- Writing new features — use the appropriate workflow skill

## Audit Model

Load `references/layers-and-failure-patterns.md` before mapping findings to the 12
layers or the common failure patterns. It is intentionally disclosed because most
audits need the workflow first and the full diagnostic vocabulary only during failure
mapping.

## Audit Workflow

### Phase 1: Scope

Define what you're auditing:

- **Target system** — what agent application?
- **Entrypoints** — how do users interact with it?
- **Model stack** — which LLM(s) and providers?
- **Symptoms** — what does the user report?
- **Time window** — when did it start?
- **Layers to audit** — which of the 12 layers apply?

### Phase 2: Evidence Collection

Gather evidence from the codebase:

- **Source code** — agent loop, tool router, memory admission, prompt assembly
- **Logs** — historical session traces, tool call records
- **Config** — prompt templates, tool schemas, provider settings
- **Memory files** — SOPs, knowledge bases, session archives

Use `rg` to search for anti-patterns:

```bash
# Tool requirements expressed only in prompt text (not code)
rg "must.*tool|必须.*工具|required.*call" --type md

# Tool execution without validation
rg "tool_call|toolCall|tool_use" --type py --type ts

# Hidden LLM calls outside main agent loop
rg "completion|chat\.create|messages\.create|llm\.invoke"

# Memory admission without user-correction priority
rg "memory.*admit|long.*term.*update|persist.*memory" --type py --type ts

# Fallback loops that run additional LLM calls
rg "fallback|retry.*llm|repair.*prompt|re-?prompt" --type py --type ts

# Silent output mutation
rg "mutate|rewrite.*response|transform.*output|shap" --type py --type ts
```

### Phase 3: Failure Mapping

For each finding, document:

- **Symptom** — what the user sees
- **Mechanism** — how the wrapper causes it
- **Source layer** — which of the 12 layers
- **Root cause** — the deepest cause
- **Evidence** — file:line or log:row reference
- **Confidence** — 0.0 to 1.0

### Phase 4: Fix Strategy

Default fix order (code-first, not prompt-first):

1. **Code-gate tool requirements** — enforce in code, not just prompt text
2. **Remove or narrow hidden repair agents** — make fallback explicit with contracts
3. **Reduce context duplication** — same info through prompt + history + memory + distillation
4. **Tighten memory admission** — user corrections > agent assertions
5. **Tighten distillation triggers** — don't compress what shouldn't be compressed
6. **Reduce rendering mutation** — pass-through, don't transform
7. **Convert to typed JSON envelopes** — structured internal flow, not freeform prose

## Severity Model

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `critical` | Agent can confidently produce wrong operational behavior | Fix before next release |
| `high` | Agent frequently degrades correctness or stability | Fix this sprint |
| `medium` | Correctness usually survives but output is fragile or wasteful | Plan for next cycle |
| `low` | Mostly cosmetic or maintainability issues | Backlog |

## Output

Present findings to the user in this order:

1. **Severity-ranked findings** (most critical first)
2. **Architecture diagnosis** (which layer corrupted what, and why)
3. **Ordered fix plan** (code-first, not prompt-first)

Do not lead with compliments or summaries. If the system is broken, say so directly.

## Quick Diagnostic Questions

When auditing an agent system, answer these:

| # | Question | If Yes → |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | Can the model skip a required tool and still answer? | Tool not code-gated |
| 2 | Does old conversation content appear in new turns? | Memory contamination |
| 3 | Is the same info in system prompt AND memory AND history? | Context duplication |
| 4 | Does the platform run a second LLM pass before delivery? | Hidden repair loop |
| 5 | Does the output differ between internal generation and user delivery? | Rendering corruption |
| 6 | Are "must use tool X" rules only in prompt text? | Tool discipline failure |
| 7 | Can the agent's own monologue become persistent memory? | Memory poisoning |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Avoid blaming the model before falsifying wrapper-layer regressions.
- Avoid blaming memory without showing the contamination path.
- Do not let a clean current state erase a dirty historical incident.
- Do not treat markdown prose as a trustworthy internal protocol.
- Do not accept "must use tool" in prompt text when code never enforces it.
- Keep findings direct, evidence-backed, and severity-ranked.

## Verification

Before delivering the audit, confirm:

- [ ] Each finding cites concrete evidence (`file:line` or `log:row`), not speculation.
- [ ] Every finding maps to one of the 12 layers and a severity (`critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`).
- [ ] Wrapper-layer regressions were falsified before the model was blamed.
- [ ] The fix plan is code-first (code-gate over prompt-tweak) and ordered by severity.
- [ ] Findings are presented severity-ranked, with no leading compliments.

## Report Schema

Audits should produce structured reports following this shape:

```json
